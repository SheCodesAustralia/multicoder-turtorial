Ok, your task is to create Myrtle!
Myrtle is the turtle that the user will move around the world, and the goal of the game is for the user to get her from one side of the beach to the ocean.

Here's the steps we'll go through to do that:

1. Actually create the turtle.
2. Give Myrtle the ability to spin and move forward.
3. Make sure Myrtle can't go through obstacles.
4. Create a point system for getting through portals and picking up food.

Got it? Awesome, let's get started!
