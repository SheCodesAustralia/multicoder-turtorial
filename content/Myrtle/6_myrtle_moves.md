Cool, so she spins.
That's particularly useful by itself, so next we'll add the ability for her to move forward.

You're in competition with the teammate working on the birds. They may or may not have already added the following code snippet, but just incase they haven't, add the following to `MoveObject.py`:

```python
# MoveObject.py

    def move_forward(self):
        ##
        self.forward(STEP_SIZE)
        ##
        pass

```

And then add the following to `Characters.py`:

```diff
# Characters.py

class UserTurtle(CustomTurtle):

    def __init__(self, colour, shape, speed, game, start_position):
        super().__init__(colour, shape, speed, game, True, start_position)
        ##
        turtle.onkey(self.turn_left, 'Left')
+        turtle.onkey(self.move_forward, 'Up')
        ##

```

Run the code and try pressing both the `left` and `up` arrow keys to make Myrtle move around the grid.
