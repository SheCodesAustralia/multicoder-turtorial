TODO: how to read code blocks (what is old/new)

What are checkpoints.

This tutorial will take you through the fundamentals of coding, while also creating a game using the Python Turtle.

There are are a few tricks to reading this tutorial.

# Blocks

{{% notice warning %}}

Red blocks mean you need to wait for a team member to reach a different checkpoint.

{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice info %}}

Orange blocks mean it is time to test your code.

{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice tip %}}

Green blocks have tips to help you complete a step.

# Code Snippets

Throughout this tutorial you'll see a few different code snippets.

Here's an example:

```python
# myfile.py
##
print('Hello, world!')
##
```

Here's how we interpret this:

-   The purple tag in the top left means this is brand new code.
-   The first line in the code snippet is the name of the file you should add this code to.
-   The new code to add is between two lines containing `##`

Here's another example:

```diff
# myfile.py
##
-print('Hello, World!)
+print('Hello, Earthlings!')
##
```

Here's how we interpret this:

-   The purple tag in the top left means that we are modifying existing code.
-   The red text is code we need to remove.
-   The green text is code we need to add.

Make sure you don't also copy the `+` when adding this code. It is there to show you this is a new line of code, but it is not part of the code itself.
