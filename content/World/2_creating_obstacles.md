title: ðŸª¨ Creating Obstacles
weight: 2

Now that we know where the center of each cell is, let's use that to place some obstacles.

Add the following to `Obstacle.py`:

```python
# Obstacle.py

class Obstacle(turtle.Turtle):

    def __init__(self, shape, position):
        super().__init__()
        ##
        self.hideturtle()
        self.speed(10)
        self.shape(shape)
        self.penup()
        self.shapesize(STEP_SIZE/STAMP_SIZE, STEP_SIZE/STAMP_SIZE, STEP_SIZE/STAMP_SIZE)
        self.goto(position)
        self.showturtle()
        ##
```

This code creates the shell of an obstacle.
It is what defines how big an obstacles should appear on the screen, and how to get to it's final position.

The next bit of code tells this code what obstacles to actually create.

Add the following to `game.py`:

```python
# game.py

game = Game()
game.create_base_world()
game.draw_world()

##
position = convert_coord_to_grid_pos((0, 7))
Obstacle(ROCK, position)
position = convert_coord_to_grid_pos((1, 7))
Obstacle(ROCK, position)
position = convert_coord_to_grid_pos((2, 1))
Obstacle(ROCK, position)
position = convert_coord_to_grid_pos((2, 2))
Obstacle(ROCK, position)
position = convert_coord_to_grid_pos((3, 2))
Obstacle(ROCK, position)
position = convert_coord_to_grid_pos((3, 6))
Obstacle(ROCK, position)
##

turtle.mainloop()
```

Run the code, you should see rocks (your obstacles) appear on the screen!
