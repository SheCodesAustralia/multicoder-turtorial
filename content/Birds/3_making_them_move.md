Cool, we have a bird.
Next step: make it move!

You're in competition with the teammate working on Myrtle. They may or may not have already added the following code snippet, but just incase they haven't, add the following to `MoveObject.py`:

```python
# MoveObject.py

    def move_forward(self):
        ##
        self.forward(STEP_SIZE)
        ##
        pass
```

And then add the following to `Characters.py`:

```python
# Characters.py

class RobotBird(CustomTurtle):
    def __init__(self, colour, shape, speed, game, start_position):
        super().__init__(colour, shape, speed, game, False, start_position)
        ##
        self.shapesize(2, 2)
        ##

    def move(self):
        ##
        num_steps = random.randint(1, 5)
        for step in range(num_steps):
            self.move_forward()
        ##
        pass
```

Finally, call the function that will actually trigger the movement in the bird.
Add the following to `Game.py`:

```python
# Game.py
turtle.listen()

game = Game()
game.create_base_world()
game.draw_world()

##
game.create_robot_bird()

game.bird.move()

##

turtle.mainloop()
```

{{% notice info %}}

Everytime you start the game the bird should move a random number of steps.
Try restarting the game a few times to see this in action.

{{% /notice %}}

But we want the turtle to keep moving right?
Add the following to `Game.py`:

```diff
# Game.py
turtle.listen()

game = Game()
game.create_base_world()
game.draw_world()

##
game.create_robot_bird()

-game.bird.move()
+while True:
+    game.bird.move()
##

turtle.mainloop()
```

{{% notice info %}}

Restart the game, the bird should keep moving around.

{{% /notice %}}
