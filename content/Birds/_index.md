Welcome!
Your task is to create the birds that Myrtle has to avoid in order to get across the beach.

Here's the steps we'll go through to do that:

1. Actually create the birds.
2. Make the birds move.
3. Make sure the birds can't go through obstacles.
4. Send Myrtle back to the start if a bird catches her.

Got it? Awesome, let's get started!
