Congratulations on finishing the tutorial!
The next step is to add the following features:

-   The team members responsible for creating Myrtle and the Bird should add their own worlds.
-   Give Myrtle the ability to move backwards when the `down` arrow key is pressed.

Now it is time to make this game your own!
Below is a list of features you could add to your game, it's up to you and your team to decide what you want to work on next.

Ideas (in no particular order):

-   At the moment food is an optional extra, can you work out how to make it a requirement to eat the food before reaching the umbrella in order to get to the next world?
-   Add more than one piece of food and/or make food randomly appear somewhere else in the grid when one piece is eaten.
-   Incorporate a timer somehow - maybe it is counting down and eating food gives you more time? Maybe you just have to make it through all the levels as fast as you can?
-   Only give Myrtle a certain number of lives - e.g. after the third collision with a bird you lose the game.

Extra challenging ideas:

-   Can you work out how to randomly generate the worlds rather than defining them in a list?
-   Give Myrtle a laser for destroying birds.
